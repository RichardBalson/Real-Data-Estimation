\subsection{Neural Mass Model} 

All neural field models can be described by a temporal and spatial response curve, and a function that relates membrane potentials to firing rates. For neural mass models the spatial element is removed from this general description such that

\begin{equation}\label{eq:conv_eq}
    v_n(t) = \frac{\alpha_{mn}}{\tau_{mn}}\int_{-\infty}^t  h_{mn}(t-t')g(v_m(t')) \,\mathrm{d}t' + v_r,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{mn}$ is a measure of the connectivity and synaptic strength between populations $m$ and $n$, $h_{mn}(t)$ is the temporal response curve, commonly referred to as a post synaptic response kernel, $\tau_{mn}$ is the time constant which indicates the average prorogation delay between populations $m$ and $n$ and $v_r$ is the resting membrane potential. The temporal response curve is a time delayed exponential decay function:
\begin{equation}
    h_{mn}(t) = \eta(t)t\exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_{mn}}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\eta(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. An example of a post synaptic response kernel can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig: FR2PSP_final}

  \begin{figure}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\centering
		\includegraphics{FR2PSPNaming.pdf}
	\caption{Impulse response of the firing rate to aggregate membrane potential function. The time constants and synaptic gains used for this figure correspond to that of background EEG~\citep{wendling2002epileptic}. The peaks of each response occur at time $\tau_{b}$ and the maximum membrane potential is $\exp(-1)G_{b}$, where $b$ is replaced by p, s and f for excitatory, and slow and fast inhibitory time constants and gains, respectively. The inhibitory populations response is shown as negative, as this is its net effect on the system.}
	\label{fig: FR2PSP_final}
\end{figure} %

The firing rate of each population is determined from an asymmetric sigmoid activation curve. The sigmoid function translates the membrane potential of a population to its effective firing rate.
\begin{align}\label{eq:sigmoid}
    g\left(v_n(t)\right) =& \frac{1}{1+\exp{\left(\varsigma_n\left(v_{0n} - v_n(t)\right)\right)}}.
\end{align}
The quantity $\varsigma_n$ describes the gradient of the sigmoidal activation function and $v_{0n}$ the membrane potential that results in half the maximum firing rate. The constant $v_{0n}$ is a lumped parameter, that includes the effect of the resting membrane potential on the activation curve. An example of the sigmoidal activation function is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig: PSP2FR_final}.

  \begin{figure}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

		\includegraphics{PSP2FRNaming.pdf}
	\caption{Sigmoidal activation curve.}
	\label{fig: PSP2FR_final}
\end{figure} %

 \dean{Write something about $v_r$ being lumped into $v_0$.}

The convolution in Equation~\ref{eq:conv_eq} can also be written as the ordinary differential equation (ODE)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2ndOrder}
    \mathrm{D}v_n(t) = \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 v_n(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2} + \frac{2}{\tau_{mn}}\frac{\mathrm{d} v_n(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{1}{\tau_{mn}^2} v_n(t) = \frac{\alpha_{mn}}{\tau_{mn}} g(v_m(t)),
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{D}$ is a differential operator. Equation~\ref{eq:2ndOrder} can be written as two partial differential equations
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2ndOrderNMM}
    \frac{\mathrm{d} v_n(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = z_n(t),\,\,\,\,\,    \frac{\mathrm{d}z_n(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\alpha_{mn}}{\tau_{mn}} g(v_m(t)) - \frac{2}{\tau_{mn}}z_n(t) - \frac{1}{\tau_{mn}^2} v_n(t),
\end{equation}
where $z_n(t)$ is the time derivative of $v_n(t)$. This forms the basis of a state-space model for all neural masses.

The simplest possible neural mass model is one that takes an input firing rate, and outputs a firing rate. A model of this is shown in Figure~\ref{fig: Simple}, where the effect of both the post synaptic response kernel and the sigmoidal activation curve are demonstrated.
