\section{Methods}

\subsection{Animal Model of Epilepsy}

In this study we make use of an \textsl{in vivo} model of temporal lobe epilepsy. In particular, we consider the tetanus toxin model of temporal lobe epilepsy, where the hippocampus is the seizure focus. This particular model was chosen as it has a localised seizure focus, and results in the animals having seizure events that are similar in terms of electrophysiology and clinical aspects to human patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. 

For this particular \textsl{in vivo} model, Sprague Dawley rats that weigh between 300-400 grams are used, with the approval of an ethics committee. Tetanus toxin is injected into the hippocampus at the location of -3.5mm anterior-posterior (AP), 3mm medial lateral and -3.5mm dorsal ventral (DV). This location is within the CA3 region of the hippocampus (Figure~\ref{fig: TetLoc}). Two depth electrodes are placed in the same location to record local field potentials from the seizure focus. A further three burr holes are made, one over the cerebellum, and two over the right hemisphere of the brain. Three electrodes are placed in the burr holes: the cerebellar electrode is used as a reference for all differential recordings, and the two electrodes over the right hemisphere are used to record local filed potentials from the surface of the brain. These electrodes are then connected to a pedestal and held in place by dental cement. The animals are left to recover for seven days, and are then recorded from 24 hours a day for six weeks.

\subsection{Neural Mass Model} 

All neural field models can be described by a temporal and spatial response curve, and a function that relates membrane potentials to firing rates. For neural mass models the spatial element is removed from this general description such that

\begin{equation}\label{eq:conv_eq}
    v_n(t) = \frac{\alpha_{mn}}{\tau_{mn}}\int_{-\infty}^t  h_{mn}(t-t')g(v_m(t')) \,\mathrm{d}t' + v_r,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{mn}$ is a measure of the connectivity and synaptic strength between populations $m$ and $n$, $h_{mn}(t)$ is the temporal response curve, commonly referred to as a post synaptic response kernel, $\tau_{mn}$ is the time constant which indicates the average prorogation delay between populations $m$ and $n$ and $v_r$ is the resting membrane potential. The temporal response curve is a time delayed exponential decay function:
\begin{equation}
    h_{mn}(t) = \eta(t)t\exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_{mn}}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\eta(t)$ is the Heaviside step function. An example of a post synaptic response kernel can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig: Simple}


The firing rate of each population is determined from an asymmetric sigmoid activation curve. The sigmoid function translates the membrane potential of a population to its effective firing rate.
\begin{align}\label{eq:sigmoid}
    g\left(v_n(t)\right) =& \frac{1}{1+\exp{\left(\varsigma_n\left(v_{0n} - v_n(t)\right)\right)}}.
\end{align}
The quantity $\varsigma_n$ describes the gradient of the sigmoidal activation function and $v_{0n}$ the membrane potential that results in half the maximum firing rate. The constant $v_{0n}$ is a lumped parameter, that includes the effect of the resting membrane potential on the activation curve. An example of the sigmoidal activation function is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig: Simple}.

 \dean{Write something about $v_r$ being lumped into $v_0$.}

The convolution in Equation~\ref{eq:conv_eq} can also be written as the ordinary differential equation (ODE)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:2ndOrder}
    \mathrm{D}v_n(t) = \frac{\mathrm{d}^2 v_n(t)}{\mathrm{d}t^2} + \frac{2}{\tau_{mn}}\frac{\mathrm{d} v_n(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{1}{\tau_{mn}^2} v_n(t) = \frac{\alpha_{mn}}{\tau_{mn}} g(v_m(t)),
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{D}$ is a differential operator. Equation~\ref{eq:2ndOrder} can be written as two partial differential equations
\begin{equation} \label{eq:2ndOrderNMM}
    \frac{\mathrm{d} v_n(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = z_n(t),\,\,\,\,\,    \frac{\mathrm{d}z_n(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\alpha_{mn}}{\tau_{mn}} g(v_m(t)) - \frac{2}{\tau_{mn}}z_n(t) - \frac{1}{\tau_{mn}^2} v_n(t),
\end{equation}
where $z_n(t)$ is the time derivative of $v_n(t)$. This forms the basis of a state-space model for all neural masses.

The simplest possible neural mass model is one that takes an input firing rate, and outputs a firing rate. A model of this is shown in Figure~\ref{fig: Simple}, where the effect of both the post synaptic response kernel and the sigmoidal activation curve are demonstrated.

(\textbf{B}) Temporal response curve for a synapse. The black line demonstrates the response of a synapse to an impulse response. The time constant ($\tau$) and synaptic gain ($\alpha$) are demonstrated in this figure. The peak response of this function is $\alpha \exp(-1)$ and the time at which this peak occurs is equal to $\tau$. \textbf{C} Somatic response curve. The black line indicates the function $g(v)$ which is a sigmoidal activation curve. This function demonstrates the resulting normalized firing rate produced by a neural population as a function of the membrane potential over it. In this figure $v_{0}$ is the membrane potential at which the firing rate produced is half its maximum.}
