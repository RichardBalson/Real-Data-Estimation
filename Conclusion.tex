\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have demonstrated that the tracking of neural dynamics using an unscented Kalman filter is feasible. We have also shown that there are clear differences between the mechanisms involved in seizure initiation and termination between and in some cases within animals. This information could be used to help with the development of new therapies. Some of the aspects that were not discussed in this paper include variability due to severity of seizures, and the long term evolution of seizures in an animal model where seizure frequency decreases over time.
